// Using a Murmur Hash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash)
// Code is used directly from the above link,
// From Wikipedia:
// MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general
// hash-based lookup.[1][2][3] It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008[4]
// and is currently hosted on GitHub along with its test suite named 'SMHasher'.
// It also exists in a number of variants,[5] all of which have been released
// into the public domain. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply
// (MU) and rotate (R), used in its inner loop.
